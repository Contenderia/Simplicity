Simplicity
==========

In the oldy time, before the now now, the big boss flew the steel bird *wooo* and the programmer felleras makes _all_ the nested ifs and switch statements *case, case, case*.

Then the FP plonkers with their F# came :boom: and with them the pattern matching and sipping decaf espressos *burn, burn, burn* and green tea smoothies in upcycled jam jars *single origin, ethically sourced*.

And now we's in the C# place *that's us* well _we_ get the pattern matching. We's ready. Take us home.
